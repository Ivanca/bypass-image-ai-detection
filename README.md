## Installation Instructions

Since this extension is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store (we're working on it!), you'll need to install it manually. Don't worry - it's easier than it sounds! Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Extension
1. Go to https://github.com/Ivanca/bypass-gpt (you already did it if you're reading this!)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Select **"Download ZIP"**
4. Once downloaded, extract/unzip the file to a folder on your computer

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter
3. Look for the toggle switch in the top-right corner that says **"Developer mode"**
4. Turn it **ON** (it should turn blue)

### Step 3: Load the Extension
1. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears after enabling Developer mode
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files
3. Select the folder and click **"Select Folder"** (or "Open" depending on your system)

### Step 4: You're Done!
The extension should now appear in your list of extensions and be ready to use. You'll see its icon in your Chrome toolbar.

**Note:** We're actively working on getting this extension published to the Chrome Web Store for easier installation. We are also working on a Firefox version. Stay tuned for updates!
